## Useful Technologies 🚀

- Docker : https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- NVM : https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- React : https://reactjs.org/
- VSCode : https://code.visualstudio.com/
- MongoDb : https://www.mongodb.com/

## Getting Started 🔥

1.  Run `docker-compose up` - This may take a while the first time you run it. (360s for me)
2.  Install the packages using Node 20 and start the react-app.
3.  Access the user form in react-app using localhost:3004.
4.  You can access the DB by using the details in docker-compose.yml file.
5.  Create a View, Edit and Delete functionality for this form.
6.  Render a table of Users to view in react-app. It should get the submissions from the database.

## Bonus Tasks ✨

Please do this if you are already comfortable with the technologies

- Style react-app using Material UI.
- Implement a checkbox in the form which will represent if the user is blocked or not in the User form.
- Add Sort and Filter functionality to the Users table using mobx.
